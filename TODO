O   GOAL 3:
    Implement User Dashboard
    O   Extend userprofile
    O   Implement the permissions when a user can lend and share (like requirements: email, phone, confirmed, etc...)

O   BookingEvent Model
O   Transaction Model
O   Delete Hook for Stuff, Booking and BookingEvents
    O   Deletes should result in stale version of the object (hook delete signal)

ISSUES:
O   on_delete=models.PROTECT means that deleting a User or other model is not possible if the Instance has associated instances. Resolve this with a active bool and on_delete hook. Also the querysets should reflect that, e.g. only active User Instances should be queried. In some cases the models.PROTECT can also be change into other viable values models.SET_NULL, etc...

FUTURE FEATURES
# O    TODO [version 0.]: Category System useful for Stuff?
# O    TODO [version 0.5]: Implement Long/Lat Functions in position App
    longitude   = models.FloatField(_('Longitude'), null=True, blank=True)
    latitude    = models.FloatField(_('Latitude'), null=True, blank=True)
# O    TODO [version 0.]: User.on_delete signal => rather set to inactive, not delete!
# O    TODO [version 0.]: Add intelligent database indices to the models for faster retrieval
# O    TODO [version 0.]: Production Database should be fast MySQL or other
